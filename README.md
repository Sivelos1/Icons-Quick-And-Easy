  # Description

  [View a video demonstration of this project here!](https://youtu.be/hGM4uwWSBCc)

  Sometimes, you just want a simple and easy icon for your project, but you dont have the artistic skills to make that happen. It doesnt have to be flashy, it just needs to be something recognizable! Thus, the SVG Logo Maker was born.

  ## Installation

  Simply download the program and run npm install to install its dependencies.

  ## Usage

  The program will ask you four questions. Answer them and the program will automatically generate a file called icon.svg for you, in the programs directory.

  ## Collaborators

  N/A

  You can run the test file using npm test, or try and input strange answers to the programs questions!
